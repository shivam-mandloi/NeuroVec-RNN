Your confident bearing
And poise are unerring
The clothes you are wearing say bum

Go and trade in your stick
For an alpenstock quick:
Get a metal-tipped grip and dont fall

Impressed by the tint of the sky
The chemist decided to try
To create the same hue
As that warm shade of blue
By concocting an aniline dye

Feeling horny asked he
Not for you! answered she
His horns were too twisted she felt

But their honeymoon ended quite fearfully
Upon sharing his bed
She lost every last shred
Of affection for him and fled tearfully
||
The farmer once harbored majestic
Ambitions beyond his agrestic
Existence so rural:

The lawyer neglected to save it
His statement in writing
Was barred from indicting
The perp so in person he gave it

Until an affiche
Was posted: A most-wanted bill

Of him clutching his throat
Then a terrible fate is predicted

Ive got angst in my pants!
And other rude things I wont mention

Unaware that a dwarf is a star
Hes unsure that theyre round
He thinks Plutos a hound
And the Milky Way Malted milk bar!

The judge rather poorly construed
The laws on the books
But I fear though it looks
Quite appealable Acme is screwed

Where some salt and a knife were displayed
Whoevers at fault

So it was no surprise

I believe that I owe an apology
For these apologues in my anthology
So said Aesop the Fabler
I hear hes now stabler
Since his animals practice psychology

Though we feared wed be leaving him stranded
The man with one arm was quite candid:
He refused to be swayed
By our offers of aid
And he took on his task singlehanded
||
Every morning I wake up and say
That Im feeling unlike me today
But the self that Ive missed
May not really exist:

An astronomerstar-gazing feller
Fit his telescope with a propeller

Wouldnt twinkle as much
What he knew about air wasnt stellar

Though the costs have become astronomical
In our UFOs lab anatomical
We continue selecting
Collecting dissecting
Earth creatures whose features seem comical
||
My most baneful and poisonous glare
And my baleful and threatening stare
Are reserved for the guys
Telling scandalous lies
While asserting theyre balanced and fair

But it came as a shock
That it started Cher Jacques
For the beau who received it was Cy

The bare-necked umbrella birds crest
Has a shape like await oh youve guessed
This black tropical bird
Has a name thats absurd
And a wattle in front of its breast

Harmonica music is poky
And polkas are painfully hokey
The experts like smoking
In bars as theyre choking
Out bars of the best karaoke
||
In a plight after plighting her trow
To a hundred new beaux in a row
She has yet to confess
How she loves to say yes
Which not one of her boys seems to know

Id have thought that the prospects were bleak
To complete such a task in a week:
In the beginning was Night
Until Let there be Light!

The satyr had wandered oblivious
That the pathway he traveled was bivious
As he seemed not to know
There were two ways to go
In pursuit of his intrests lascivious

Way too noisy We cant understand
Why hes running amok
Was it simply bad luck
Hes not calm like the child that wed planned
||
I would bet on our getting bogged down
In that bog thats a slog out of town
With our luck well get stuck

Wondrous pictures appear
But the sounds that I hear
Include messages meant for a boob

My Auntie Diluvians peeve:
Shes so ancient its hard to conceive
She remembers the Ark
Butin contrast so stark

With a game fish that measures 3 feet
Its your catch of the day
I should snatch it away:
It has too many bonelets to eat

Two nations improving their ties
When they reach an accord
On which both are aboard
Advantageous in everyones eyes

Hit the nail on the head
When he said What a tool! Whats hes doing

Had their ménage-à-trois go astray
With their typical luck
They could not come unstuck
And emerged as an azide today

Where they nap for the day
But then happily play
And carouse with their minuscule spouses

When the flaws in construction were noted
Since that boatbuilders craft
Had too shallow a draft
Rafts of problems bobbed up when it floated

There is naught I can do
With our mutinous crew
Thats abundantly bountifully clear

And reveals more than hides
In a half-assed attempt to conceal

The old black-crested night heron might
Wade the marshes at will
Long of leg neck and bill
Nasty-tempered and picking a fight

Wrap my wrists round my toes with straight knees
Touch my thighs with my chest
Hear my painful request:
No more anelasticity please!
||
The support she would never deny a sis
Counters Angie the Elephants biases

This religion wont do
I shall atheize you
Deny God or Hell bring on a drought!

Now lies under a cross
Slowly gathering moss
While we strive to divine the divine

Of sheer magic on me since I fell
The enchantment I feel
Is sublime but unreal
If Im lost thats just fine This is swell

Features several with tails sharp as arrows
From the fens where they skulk

Just eight people would vote
To catch rides on that boat
And these humans would archonts debark

And you speak in the hand-set: Allo

Twist your hips til your torso turns blue
Flit about like a starling
