The verb definitions
By limerick conditions

To our abject disdain
Artificial intelligence rules!

With a suitable mate

Well drink pink lemonade
On the long promenade:

Rise up in their stands
Loudly clapping their hands to aggrace me

And eyes almond a shape

And anger ensued
So now Im contused and abused
